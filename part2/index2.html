<h1>Assigment 4: Civil Engeneering Expanded</h1>

<h3><br>Identify the educational institution:
</h3>
<p>The educational institution that I would plan going to in order to further my education and study civil engineering should I go down that path would be the University of Toronto (U of T). The Program which I would take would be the Civil Engineering Undergraduate Program which goes over Building Science, Construction Management, Environmental Engineering, Mining & Geomechanics, Structural Engineering, Transportation Engineering and Planning. 
</p>

<h3><br>Entrance requirements:
</h3>
<p>The entrance requirements to get into the Civil Engineering Undergraduate Program include: Advanced Functions (MHF4U), Calculus & Vectors (MCV4U), Chemistry (SCH4U), English (ENG4U), Physics (SPH4U), and Supplemental Application Required. It may also be useful to take other highschool courses that are related to increasing your knowledge before getting into the program.
</p>

<h3><br>Description of first year program (courses) that you would take:
</h3>
<p>In the Fall term the courses that we would go over in the Civil Engineering Undergraduate Program include: Orientation to Engineering, Engineering Strategies & Practice I, Mechanics, Engineering Chemistry & Materials Science, Linear Algebra and Calculus I. For the Winter Term the courses will include: Engineering Strategies & Practice II, Fundamentals of Computer Programming, Calculus II, Physical Chemistry, Earth Systems Science, Intro to Civil Engineering.
</p>

<h3><br>Sample  of other things necessary to complete the degree or diploma requirements:
</h3>
<p>Other things that are necessary to meet and complete the degree/diploma requirements that you may need to complete the degree can include being certified, having work experience and having a high school diploma. 
</p>

<h3><br>The length of time to complete the degree or diploma for the course:
</h3>
<p>The length to complete a Bachelor of Applied Science degree in Civil Engineering at the University of Toronto is offered over a 4-year timespan which makes it an 8 semester program. The civil engineering course is offered on a full-time basis and includes 120 - 150 credits depending on the academic background of the student taking the course.
</p>

<h3><br>How will your vocation help the common good? How will your vocation enable you to set appropriate goals and priorities in school, work and personal life?
</h3>
<p>My vocation will help the common good because by working as a Civil Engineer I will be able to apply my knowledge to the good of my community and I will be able to improve the quality of life for everyone in my town or city. This vacation will also enable me to set appropriate goals and priorities in and outside of school by giving me something big to work towards (Getting into a Civil engineering program). This will also affect my personal life for the better because it will help motivate me to achieve my learning goals.
